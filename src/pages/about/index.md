## About Us

Mash Heads is a small San Diego based homebrew club dedicated to educating our members on the science of homebrewing while focusing on fun and camaraderie.

Our mission is to promote awareness and appreciation of all aspects of the brewing process as well as beer judging through education, evaluation, and open discussion.

We are a proud member of the San Diego Homebrewers Alliance, an umbrella group that was formed by local homebrewers for the purpose of supporting each other as well as to promote homebrewing to the San Diego community.
